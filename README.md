Hello! This is an assignment for my first JavaScript lesson.
The goal was to create a plain HTML page in which some prompts ask user's name, surname and favourite color in order to generate a simple password.
Since I enjoyed the task, I decided to sparkle a bit of style on my page simply using BootStrap 5 (which was last assigment's topic).

I hope you enjoyed this! :)
